# todo-list.rs
Just a silly project I made to help learn rust!
I am currently new to rust so the code is probably horrible.

Hoping to improve it in the future as I get better at rust :)

It saves your todo in a file and in the future, on linux it will store it in your `~/.config` or somewhere else if I figure out a better way.
I'm also hoping to eventually implement cross platform support!

## Usage

## Todo! (lol)
- [ ] add todo
- [ ] delete todo
- [ ] save todo to an actually reasonable directory
- [ ] finish usage section
- [ ] some nice photos for the readme :)
- [ ] refactor as I get better at rust
- [ ] maybe easy github/cloud sync?
