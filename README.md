# todo-list.rs
Just a silly project I made to help learn rust!
I am currently new to rust so the code is probably horrible.

Hoping to improve it in the future as I get better at rust :)

If you are experienced at rust and want to show a different way to do things go ahead! Please explain why and how it works if you do so though.

This is also my first time making a GUI at all so sorry for low quality

> [!NOTE]
> Completely redoing the entire project in GTK (very much a work in progress)
