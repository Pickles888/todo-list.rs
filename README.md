# todo-list.rs
Just a silly project I made to help learn rust!
I am currently new to rust so the code is probably horrible.

Hoping to improve it in the future as I get better at rust :)

If you are experienced at rust and want to show a different way to do things go ahead! Please explain why and how it works if you do so though.

## Usage
USAGE: todo [COMMAND] [ID]

COMMANDS:
add     Adds an item
rm      Removes an item
list    Lists todo 
help    Prints help

## Todo! (lol)
- [x] add todo
- [x] delete todo
- [x] add cmdline args
- [ ] save todo to an actually reasonable directory
- [x] add a [flake](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes) for development and running remotely
- [x] finish [usage](https://github.com/Pickles888/todo-list.rs?tab=readme-ov-file#usage) section
- [ ] some nice photos for the readme :)
- [ ] refactor as I get better at rust
- [ ] maybe easy github/cloud sync?
